This folder contains the first assignment for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a> - a web development course that I'm following.

<p>This assignment is a practice of HTML basics - it was originally about recipes, but I prefer <a href="https://github.com/Emma-Selmeci/BoardGameElements">board games<a>

This project demonstrates some basic HTML features such as text formatting, lists, links and images.
